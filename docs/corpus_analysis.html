            <h1>Harry Potter Movie Text Analysis Project</h1>
            <h2>Initial Idea</h2>
                <p>
                    For my corpus analysis I wanted to used Harry Potter as my texts of choice. I specifically wanted 
                    to use this series becuase of the big words, the South-Eastern British accent, and the use of fiction words in the spells and charms.
                    Thinking back on the movies, I seem to remember a tonal shift throughout the books. From memory, I felt as though 
                    the earlier books had a more childish lighter tone and as the story unfolded over the course of the series, the tone became darker and more serious.
                    I want to analyze the text throughout the series and see if I can find trends or data that supports the tonal shift I hypothesized.
                    <br></br>
                    I will be using the screenplays from all 8 movies as it is difficult to get the text from the books 
                    without paying money. The screenplays/scrips were provided by a former student. 
                    Thanks to Bianka Alexander and others involved for providing clean, solid versions of the screenplays for me to analyze. 
                    See the source texts <a href="https://github.com/beealex/harryPotter/tree/master/finalTextCorpus">here</a>.

            <h2>The Plan</h2>
                <p>
                    Searching for a tonal shift by pure text analysis seemed difficult to fully explore to me. 
                    I feel as though what sets the tone is more than only a few or less words. 
                    For this reason I have chosen a few tactics to proceed with my analysis.
                    I will be searching for more unique results that can be expressed within only a few words, but still relate to an emotion, feeling, tone, or other meaningfull terms.

                    The criteria I will mainly be searching for is as follows:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Names that invoke a tone </li>
                        <li> Spells that relate to either playfulness, utility, destruction, or combat to name a few</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    </br>
                    Using these terms, I feel as though I will be able to identify themes throughout the movies that suggest certain tones.
                </p>
                <img src="images/SeaFoamLine.png" alt="Line" class="corpus__line"/>
            <h2>Criteria</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to distinguish certain tones we must create certain criteria that our search terms will fill. 
                    These four categories will attempt to represent different themes throughout the books.
                </p>
                <h3>Playfullness</h3>
                <h4>
                    A lighter tone. Typically terms relating to jokes, pranks, friendship and more.
                </h4>
                <h3>Utility</h3>
                <h4>
                    Possibly relating to mischievousness, terms that fit this category may suggest a lighter or darker tone.
                </h4>
                <h3>Combat</h3>
                <h4>
                    With a more serious quality, combat represents only dangerous situations or serious instructional settings.
                </h4>
                <h3>Destruction</h3>
                <h4>
                    Used only in a dark setting. Terms like, these when mentioned in the movies, cause a tonal shift by themselves to a more darker theme.
                </h4>
                <p>
                </br>
                Using these categories, I will be able to organize my findings and weave my data together to find a result.
                </p>

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    With my categories created, it was time to find and decided which terms in the screenplays 
                    accuratly represent such tones. After watching all 8 movies over the course of the past week 
                    I took wrote down notable terms that stuck out to me during my viewings. Secondly I used an 
                    <a href="https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-spells-list-from-movies-and-books/">online resource</a> that listed all the spells that were used in the movies.
                    <br></br>
                    After picking from the lengthly list of spells and my own experiences while watching the series, I have placed a number of terms into the categories listed:
