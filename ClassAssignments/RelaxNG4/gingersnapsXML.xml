    <desc>These crunchy, spicy rounds with their cracked, sugary tops are equally at home dunked in
        tea, coffee, or milk, and frequently enjoyed during the November/December holiday season.
        But they're just as welcome on a mellow, golden, late-September afternoon, with a
        comfortable lounge chair and a large glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade.</desc>

    <instructions><header>Instructions</header> Preheat the oven to <num>375</num><unit>Â°F</unit>.
        Lightly grease (or line with parchment) <num>two</num> baking sheets. Beat together the
        shortening, sugar, salt, and baking soda. Beat in the egg, then the molasses. Add the flour
        and spices, beating to make a smooth, fairly stiff dough. To make the coating, combine the
        sugar and cinnamon, and place in a shallow pan or dish. Drop the dough in
            <num>1</num><unit>inches</unit> balls into the cinnamon-sugar mixture; a teaspoon cookie
        scoop is perfect here. Roll the balls in the sugar to coat, then transfer them to the
        prepared baking sheets, leaving at least <num type="mixedNum">1 1/2</num><unit>inches</unit>
        between them; they'll spread as they bake. Bake the cookies for <num>11</num>
        <unit>minutes</unit>, for cookies that are crisp around the edges, and "bendy" in the
        center. Bake for <num>13</num>
        <unit>minutes</unit>, for cookies that are crisp/crunchy all the way through. Remove the
        cookies from the oven, and cool right on the pan, or on a rack. Cool completely, then store
        tightly wrapped, at room temperature.</instructions>
